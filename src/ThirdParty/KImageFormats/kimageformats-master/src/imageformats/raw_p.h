     * @brief m_quality
     * Change the quality of the conversion. If -1, default quality is used.
     * @note Verify that the quality change support has been compiled with supportsOption()
     *
     * When the quality value is negative (but not -1), we assume we want to work with flags according to the following scheme:
     *   3                   2                 1           0
     * 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 87 6 5 4 3 2 1098 7654 3210
     * 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ S F NN E H B A W CCCC IIII ____
     *
     * Where:
     * _: reserved (should be zero)
     * I: interpolation quality (0 - linear, 1 - VNG, 2 - PPG, 3 - AHD, 4 - DCB, 11 - DHT, 12 - AAHD)
     * C: output colorspace (0 - raw, 1 - sRGB, 2 - Adobe, 3 - Wide, 4 - ProPhoto, 5 - XYZ, 6 - ACES, 7 - DCI-P3, 8 - Rec2020)
     * W: use camera white balace (0 - off, 1 - on)
     * A: use auto white balance (0 - off, 1 - on)
     * B: output bit per sample (0 - 8-bits, 1 - 16-bits)
     * H: half size image (0 - off, 1 - on)
     * E: DCB color enhance (0 - off, 1 - on)
     * N: FBDD noise reduction (0 - off, 1 - light, 2 - full)
     * F: Interpolate RGGB as four colors (0 - off, 1 - on)
     * S: Don't stretch or rotate raw pixels (0 - rotate and stretch, 1 - don't rotate and stretch)
     * @note It is safe to set both W and A: W is used if camera white balance is found, otherwise A is used.
     *
     * When quality is a positive value, a value between 0 and 100 is expected. The values are interpreted as follows:
     * - 00   : Embedded preview, if fails same as Half-Size (01-09)
     * - 01-09: I =  0, C = 1, B = 0, W = 1, A = 1, H = 1 (Linear, sRGB, 8-bits, Camera White, Auto White, Half-size)
     * - 10-19: I =  0, C = 1, B = 0, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (Linear, sRGB, 8-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     * - 20-29: I =  3, C = 1, B = 0, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (AHD, sRGB, 8-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     * - 30-39: I =  3, C = 1, B = 1, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (AHD, sRGB, 16-bits, Camera White, Auto White) [Default]
     * - 40-49: I =  3, C = 2, B = 1, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (AHD, Adobe, 16-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     * - 50-59: I =  3, C = 4, B = 1, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (AHD, ProPhoto, 16-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     * - 60-69: I = 11, C = 1, B = 0, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (DHT, sRGB, 8-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     * - 70-79: I = 11, C = 1, B = 1, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (DHT, sRGB, 16-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     * - 80-89: I = 11, C = 2, B = 1, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (DHT, Adobe, 16-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     * - >= 90: I = 11, C = 4, B = 1, W = 1, A = 1, H = 0 (DHT, ProPhoto, 16-bits, Camera White, Auto White)
     *
     * When the quality is -1, default quality is used.
